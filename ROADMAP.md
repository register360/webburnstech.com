* **Client Portal:** Develop a secure client portal (SaaS-style) allowing clients to track project progress, manage contracts, and submit feedback directly.
* **Advanced AI Services:** Expand the AI backend to offer specific, proprietary WebburnsTech tools (e.g., AI-powered SEO analysis, code snippet generation).
* **Microservices Architecture:** Refactor large backend servers into modular, dedicated microservices for improved resilience and deployment speed.
