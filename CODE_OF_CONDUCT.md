# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

Last updated: 2025-10-19

## Our Pledge

As contributors and maintainers of WebburnsTech, we pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone. We are committed to fostering an open, welcoming, and inclusive environment that protects user safety, personal dignity, and productive collaboration.

We expect all participants to abide by these standards in all project spaces including GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, mailing lists, chat channels, conference talks, and events organized by the project.

## Our Standards

Examples of positive behavior by project participants include:

- Demonstrating respect and empathy toward others.
- Being considerate in language and actions.
- Listening to and valuing different perspectives and experiences.
- Giving constructive, actionable, and respectful feedback.
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by mistakes or miscommunications.

Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form (including on the basis of race, religion, age, disability, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, or other protected characteristic).
- Threats of violence, harassment, stalking, or doxxing.
- Sustained disruption of project discussions or other deliberate actions that create a hostile environment.
- Personal insults, public shaming, derogatory jokes, or demeaning language.
- Posting or sharing sexually explicit, violent, or otherwise inappropriate content.
- Publishing private or personally identifying information (PII) without explicit consent.
- Retaliation against anyone who reports a behavior in good faith.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces and events associated with WebburnsTech, whether online or in-person, and to contributors representing the project in external public forums.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it promptly and confidentially using one of the following channels:

- Preferred (private/email): conduct@webburnstech.dev
- Alternate: support@webburnstech.dev
- If you cannot use email, open a private GitHub issue addressed to project maintainers and mark it as confidential.

When reporting, please include as much of the following as possible:

- Your contact information and whether you request anonymity.
- The date, time (UTC), and location of the incident (URL, channel, or event name).
- A description of what occurred, with links, screenshots, or copies of messages if available.
- Names of individuals involved and any witnesses.
- Any immediate actions you would like the maintainers to take (e.g., temporary moderation, blocking, or escalation).

We will acknowledge receipt of a report within 3 business days and, where possible, provide an estimated timeline for resolution.

## Enforcement and Consequences

The WebburnsTech project leadership will review all credible reports of unacceptable behavior and determine appropriate and proportionate corrective action. Possible actions include:

- Private warning or required apology.
- Temporary or permanent removal of contributor access (issue/PR/merge rights).
- Temporary or permanent ban from project spaces and communication channels.
- Referral to platform administrators or law enforcement when criminal activity is alleged.

Decisions will be handled on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the severity of the incident, the reporterâ€™s wishes, and the safety of the community. The enforcement team will treat reports confidentially to the extent possible, disclosing information only to those who need to know to investigate or take action.

## Mediation and Appeals

If you are subject to enforcement action and believe it was taken in error, you may request an appeal by contacting conduct@webburnstech.dev and providing additional context or evidence. Appeals will be reviewed by an impartial group of maintainers or an external advisor when appropriate.

## Moderation Process

- Triage: Reports are triaged by the Code of Conduct officers (project maintainers or designated moderators).
- Investigation: Relevant messages, logs, and evidence are reviewed. The maintainers may contact the reporter and involved parties for clarification.
- Action: Reasonable measures are applied to stop the behavior and prevent recurrence.
- Follow-up: Affected parties are informed of outcomes and available support resources where appropriate.
- Post-incident: When suitable and with consent, a public summary of actions taken may be published.

## Confidentiality & Safety

We prioritize the safety and privacy of reporters and affected individuals. Where necessary, we will take immediate protective measures (such as removing content, suspending accounts, or changing access controls) before a full investigation is completed.

## Commitment to Improvement

WebburnsTech is committed to continuously improving the inclusivity and safety of our community. We will periodically review and update this Code of Conduct, moderation procedures, and reporting channels to reflect community needs and best practices.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is based on the Contributor Covenant v2.1 (https://www.contributor-covenant.org), adapted for WebburnsTech. We thank that project and its maintainers for providing a robust, community-focused foundation.
